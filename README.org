#+TITLE: atomate2

*ðŸ‘‰ [[https://materialsproject.github.io/atomate2/][Full Documentation]] ðŸ‘ˆ*

* Overview
Atomate2 is a free, open-source software for performing complex
materials science workflows using simple Python functions. Features of
atomate2 include

- It is built on open-source libraries:
  [[https://pymatgen.org][pymatgen]],
  [[https://materialsproject.github.io/custodian/][custodian]],
  [[https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/][jobflow]], and
  [[https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/][FireWorks]].
- A library of "standard" workflows to compute a wide variety of desired
  materials properties.
- The ability scale from a single material, to 100 materials, or 100,000
  materials.
- Easy routes to modifying and chaining workflows together.
- It can build large databases of output properties that you can query,
  analyze, and share in a systematic way.
- It automatically keeps meticulous records of jobs, their directories,
  runtime parameters, and more.

*Note*: Atomate2 is primarily built to work with the
[[https://www.vasp.at][VASP]] electronic structure software, but we are
actively working on adding more codes.

* Workflows
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: workflows
:END:
Some of the workflows available in atomate2 are:

- electronic band structures
- elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric tensors
- one-shot electron-phonon interactions
- electronic transport using
  [[https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/amset/][AMSET]]

It is easy to customize and compose any of the above workflows.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:
This fork makes atomate2 a poetry package, ensuring reproducible
installations.

atomate2 is dependent on packages best managed through conda. Thus,
development is performed within a conda virtual environment.

install and use the [[https://pypi.org/project/conda-lock/][conda-lock]] package to install this fork.

: pip install --user conda-lock
or
: conda install -c conda-forge conda-lock

** users
*** from source
: git clone https://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/atomate2.git
: cd atomate2
: conda-lock install -n a2 -f a2.conda-lock.yaml

to install fireworks as well run

: conda-lock install -e fireworks -n a2 -f a2.conda-lock.yml

** developers
To ensure contributors maintain the package's reproducibility read the
following instructions carefully.
*** installation
a2.lock is to be used for generating the atomate virtual environment.

: git clone https://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/atomate2.git
: cd atomate2
: conda create -p/depot/<PI_username>/apps/conda/envs/a2
: conda activate a2
: conda env update -f a2.yaml

Here path is specified for a group-wide depot installation.
*** modifying environment
**** install new package
**** update existing package
: conda-lock lock --lockfile a2.conda-lock.yml --update <package-name>
**** resolve environment
: conda-lock -f pyproject.toml --lockfile a2.conda-lock.yml

* Quick start
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: quick-start
:END:
Workflows in atomate2 are written using the
[[https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/][jobflow]] library.
Workflows are generated using =Maker= objects which have a consistent
API for modifying input settings and chaining workflows together. Below,
we demonstrate how to run a band structure workflow (see the
[[https://materialsproject.github.io/atomate2/user/codes/vasp.html#relax-and-band-structure][documentation]]
for more details). In total, 4 VASP calculations will be performed:

1. A structural optimisation.
2. A self-consistent static calculation on the relaxed geometry.
3. A non-self-consistent calculation on a uniform k-point mesh (for the
   density of states).
4. A non-self-consistent calculation on a high symmetry k-point path
   (for the line mode band structure).

#+begin_src python
from atomate2.vasp.flows.core import RelaxBandStructureMaker
from jobflow import run_locally
from pymatgen.core import Structure

# construct a rock salt MgO structure
mgo_structure = Structure(
    lattice=[[0, 2.13, 2.13], [2.13, 0, 2.13], [2.13, 2.13, 0]],
    species=["Mg", "O"],
    coords=[[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]],
)

# make a band structure flow to optimise the structure and obtain the band structure
bandstructure_flow = RelaxBandStructureMaker().make(mgo_structure)

# run the flow
run_locally(bandstructure_flow, create_folders=True)
#+end_src

Before the above code can run successfully, you'll need to

- tell pymatgen where to
  [[https://pymatgen.org/installation.html#potcar-setup][find your pseudopotential files]]
- tell atomate2 where to find your VASP binary
- (optionally) prepare an external database to store the job output

In this example, we execute the workflow immediately. In many cases, you
might want to perform calculations on several materials simultaneously.
To achieve this, all atomate2 workflows can be run using the
[[https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/][FireWorks]] software.
See the
[[https://materialsproject.github.io/atomate2/user/fireworks.html][documentation]]
for more details.
